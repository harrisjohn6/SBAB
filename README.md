Jesus be a fence, this is a learning exercise for me, I am far from what anyone would title a developer. If you are going to be judgmental on how
I am doing things by all means find projects from more experienced people. 

I welcome opportunities to learn from experts and will always aim to provide the best available software I can. With this tidbit out the way I will
tell you more on the project. 


Sbab stands for Small Business Address Book, it's not the final name for the project, just something so that I could start development. I am looking
to provide an application where small business owners can reach customers who are lookikng for products they would tend to by at larger B&M stores
or simply shop online. The goal is to encourgae shoppers to shop small businesses first.
